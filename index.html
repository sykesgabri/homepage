            Hi. I'm Gabriel Sykes.<br>
			Some people call me Gabe.<br>
			<br>
			I am a young and almost talentless musician. I am also looking into doing youtube again but actually putting some amount of production quality into my content.<br>
			This will take a while though as I am currently saving up to buy a whole bunch of stuff at once to improve my current setup so that my content can have good production quality right from the start.<br>
			Yes I said "doing youtube again". I made a total of 19 vids between 2014 and 2019 earning me ~3045 total views and 29 subscribers. Don't go looking for any of it, I privated all the vids because they're bad and cringey and embarrasing and bad!
        </p>
		<br>
		<p class="rp">
			The problems with this content were as follows:<br>
				<br>
			<ul class="rul">
                <li class="rli">No scripts were written for the videos. &bull;</li>
				<br>
                <li class="rli">I had poor presentation and acting skills. &bull;</li>
				<br>
                <li class="rli">I also had an annoying squeaker voice (Which I thankfully don't have anymore, it started subtly dropping somewhere around October 2017 and then dropped a significant amount between early 2018 and mid 2019). &bull;</li>
				<br>
                <li class="rli">My videos had very poor audio quality. The microphones I used were cheap and never good, I knew nothing about how to make audio sound good and that resulted in a lot of horribly bad audio. &bull;</li>
				<br>
                <li class="rli">My videos often had poor lighting. The only light I ever used was the one (yellow, not white) ceiling light in my bedroom, this made colours look unnatural and certain areas weren't lit adequately. &bull;</li>
				<br>
                <li class="rli">Most of my videos had poor video quality. I recorded using a cheap 480p 15FPS webcam, a cheap windows phone that I had in the very early days of my channel. Even though quality and framerate improved as I got better phones over the years I barely ever used a tripod and never used a gimbal which resulted in inconsitent or shaky footage. &bull;</li>
            </ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="lp">
            I plan to make better content by investing in better gear (I actually did my research and know exactly what stuff I wanna buy), writing scripts and working on improving my presentation and acting skills.<br>
			Other improvements will include better editing, my own original music, maybe streaming (idk if I'm gonna bother with streaming, maybe, MAYBE, NOT DEFINITELY), etc.<br>
			<br>
			Anyway, I hope that you will enjoy my future content and whatever I decide to put up for you guys.<br>
			Have fun doing what you do and try not to die, that's bad.<br>
			<br>
			Gabe out!
